## Synopsis

Source code for the map editor project (you can download the executable at http://rakiah.com/nmeditor/nmeditor.rar)


## Why ?

one of the artist (Alexandre Christmann) that was originally working on Ninja Momie (Heart stroke Hits Playtime)
wanted to continue the project after the event and asked me if it was possible to build an editor for players
so they can create their own map and share it with a community.
i liked the idea and tought it could be fun so i did it, sadly, one of the artist didn't want to continue
the project which mean we couldn't go further, im opening sources there if anyone is interested.
don't judge too harshly tho, i was young ;P
